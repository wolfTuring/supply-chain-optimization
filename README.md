## üìä Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **End-to-End Supply Chain Analytics Pipeline** that solves the **Capacitated Plant Location Problem** using linear programming optimization. The solution helps manufacturing companies determine optimal facility locations and production allocations to minimize total operational costs while meeting customer demand constraints.

## üìã Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Pandas and NumPy for multi-node network optimization datasets
- **Optimization Engine**: Linear programming (PuLP) for facility location and shipment planning
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for cost structure and supply chain flow analysis
- **Interactive Analysis**: Jupyter Notebook for reproducible workflows

## üéØ Problem Statement

Manufacturing companies with global operations need to optimize facility locations and production allocations across multiple geographic locations (USA, Germany, Japan, Brazil, India) while balancing fixed costs, variable costs, and transportation expenses to minimize total operational costs.

## üìä Results

The optimization model provides:

- **Optimal Plant Locations**: Which facilities to open and their capacity levels
- **Production Allocation**: How much to produce at each location
- **Cost Minimization**: Total operational cost breakdown
- **Scenario Analysis**: Impact of different constraints and parameters
